# Vector Analysis Useful Functions

This repository is dedicated to create some useful functions to do vector analysis. This repository has an MIT license meaning you can edit, modify, use these codes in your commercials without any hesitations. Feel free to fork and contribute to this repository. Mainly I will use python to code in this repository. But when needed C/C++ can also be used.

<h1> Acknowledgement </h1>
I had a course titled `MAT 201E: Vector Analysis and Complex Variables` in my sophomore year. Our beloved teacher Md. Salah Uddin sir took that course and tried enough to grow our interest on vector analysis. He helped us visualizing these mathematical formulas by drawing many 3D shaped figures. I was able to find a reallife `3bllue1brown` and that was our sir Md. Salah Uddin. So, I am dedicating this repository to our beloved sir.
